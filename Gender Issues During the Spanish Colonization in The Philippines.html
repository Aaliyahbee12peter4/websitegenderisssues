  <h2 style= "text-align: center;"> History is Equal to Herstory!</h2>
  <h3 style= "text-align: center;"> Gender issues occur everywhere, especially in the Philippines. Filipino women were discriminated against not only because of their gender but also of their class, and religion, women were also stripped of rights before.

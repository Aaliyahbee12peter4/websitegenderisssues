<h2 style="font-family:verdana;color:red;">LIST OF IDENTIFIED SOLUTIONS:</h2>

<ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman">

<li><b>Educate the general public</b> about gender issues through fun and memorable events.</li>
<p>
According to Edgar Dale, the creator of the triangle of learning, showing the percentage of students remembering something. It shows that fully experiencing and witnessing the event will lead to a greater chance of remembering their experience. About 30%, though it is seemingly low, is far better than just reading about it or just hearing it.
</p>

<p>
<li><b>Promote gender equality among students </b> by avoiding separating genders into different seats and lines and mixing each gender to work on projects together, treating them equally, and educating them to stand up for their rights.
</p>
According to Gray Group International, In their topic “Promoting Gender Equality: The Educational Imperative” It states in the section why gender equality in education is important says Gender equality in education also means that the school system is inclusive, responsive, and empowering for all students, regardless of their gender.
Girls’ education, alongside improved sexual and reproductive health and rights, has often been cited as the world’s best investment.
<p>
An example of how this could work was during the Spanish colonization. Men were the only ones taught and were allowed to go to school. We or their teachers can be able to teach those men on how to respect and create gender equality during that time</li>
</p>

<li><b>Post awareness in newspapers,</b> trying to raise awareness to the richer people, hoping to awaken them and make them realize that what they are doing is not favorable to the public and that the more they do this, the more the Indios will rebel.
<p>
According to David Klein, the one who wrote 9 Facts That Prove Newspaper Advertising Is Still Effective in 2022
Newsprint is a very effective advertisement for spreading awareness to the public. Since we literally used it to communicate back then, why not use it to provide information to the general public about gender issues</li>
</p>

<li><b>Distributing posters in different areas to raise awareness</b> among people who are not aware of women's values, preaching to the church, and reading the verses that indicate that women and men are equal and should take care of each other.
<p>
According to Red17 a company that specializes in poster frames etc posters are still very helpful for spreading awareness to people as of now why not use them in the 1800s hundreds isn't it gonna be more effective when people relied on paper to communicate back then think of it it is gonna be helpful for uneducated people because they can learn it on the poster.</li>
</p>

<li><b>Promoting how to embrace and support the different capabilities of each other,</b> like for example we are all different genders but we should know that the opposite gender can also have the capability of doing what the other gender can do. 
<p>
According to Daylon Caldwell who wrote the article “The power of public education: why supporting it benefits everyone, by supporting each others capabilities it provides Equal opportunities such as public education. Based on the article public education serves as an equalizer, providing opportunities for students from all backgrounds to receive a quality education. It ensures that no child is denied access to learning based on their socioeconomic status, race, or other factors such as gender.
</p>
<p>
For example: we can create ways to promote it by writing a book like how Jose Rizal did during that time. But instead it is about promoting how to embrace the capabilities of each gender.</li>
